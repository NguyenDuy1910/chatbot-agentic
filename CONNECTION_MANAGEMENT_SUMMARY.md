## 🔧 Integration

The connection management system has been fully integrated into the admin dashboard:

1. **Router Integration** - Added to `src/lib/router.ts`
2. **Admin Dashboard** - Integrated into `src/components/admin/AdminDashboard.tsx`
3. **Navigation** - Added to dashboard tabs in `src/components/admin/DashboardTabs.tsx`

## 🚦 API Endpoints

### Connection Management
- `GET /api/connections` - List connections with filtering
- `POST /api/connections` - Create new connection
- `GET /api/connections/{id}` - Get specific connection
- `PUT /api/connections/{id}` - Update connection
- `DELETE /api/connections/{id}` - Delete connection

### Testing & Monitoring
- `POST /api/connections/test` - Test connection configuration
